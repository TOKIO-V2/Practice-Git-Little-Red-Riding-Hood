                Once upon a time there was a girl called Little Red Riding Hood, she really liked to visit her grandmother. One day, the
                Little Red Riding Hood's mother told her to go and bring food to her
                granny.

                Little Red Riding Hood was walking through the forest when she realized that
                someone was looking at her. It was the big bad wolf.

                The big bad wolf asked Little Red Riding Hood where she was going. She
                He answered that he was going with his beloved grandmother. He told her to take a
                shortest way and Little Red Riding Hood accepted.

                Meanwhile, the wolf ran to grandma's house.
                He locked the poor grandmother in the closet. The wolf then
                He dressed in his grandmother's clothes and went to bed.

                Little Red Riding Hood arrived at grandmother's house. She thought that
                Grandma seemed a little strange and different.

                Grandma, what big eyes, nose and ears you have! -said
                Little Red Riding Hood –They are to see you, smell you, and hear you better my dear.
                girl –said the wolf.
                --Grandma, what a big mouth and teeth you have! -said
                Little Red Riding Hood "They are to eat you!" said the wolf. In that, the wolf
                He jumps out of bed to grab Little Red Riding Hood.
